 * bits of an address locate a paging table in the paging directory.
 *
 * If bit 6 of the corresponding page directory entry is 0, the next 10 bits of
 * the address locate a page in the page table. The least significant 12 bits
 * of an address determine an offset within this page.
 *
 * If bit 6 of a page directory entry is 1, it describes a 4 Mbyte page. The
 * least significant 22 bits of an address determine an offset within this
 * page.
 *
 * Each entry of the paging directory or a paging table is built as follows:
 *
 * Bits  | Used In | Description
 * ------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------
 * 12-32 | both    | physical address of the memory page aligned to 4K
 * 9-11  | both    | user flags, can be used by the operating system
 * 8     | table   | global, will not be updated when new dir is loaded
 * 7     | dir     | 4 MByte page is described instead of page table
 * 6     | table   | dirty, set by processor on write access to page
 * 5     | table   | accessed, set by processor on read access to page
 * 4     | both    | cache disabled
 * 3     | both    | write through caching enabled
 * 2     | both    | user (i.e. non ring 0) can access page
 * 1     | both    | write access allowed
 * 0     | both    | present in physical memory
 *
 * Unused bits should remain 0.
 *
 * Global pages will not be updated, if a new paging directory is loaded to 
 * CR3. In GrÃ¤tz.OS it is used for the kernel memory, as it is mapped to the
