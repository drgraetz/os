     For each platform, the following must be defined:
     - compiler parameters
     - the name of the qemu executable
     - qemu parameters
     - the cpu on which it is run as it is passed as -mcpu parameter to the
       assembler and as -mtune parameter to the compiler
     
     Multiple symbols may be defined, which are used to invoke the linker. -->
